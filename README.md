1. To Do while test is running:: After ckicking the process button, captcha gets visible which can not be automated, also not adviced to automate.
 So Human intervention is needed there. Once captcha is entered correctly, Tests will run further.

2. Note: Capturing the window handles is done for google login popup but the flow will not be completed as Google blocks/do not support any automated interactions. Also if want to move ahead first screen please provide the creds in code.

3. As part of Selenium grid, two types of browsers has been added in TestNG file. As an enhancement , this can be implemented to run on different machines.
4. The Test case to verify the unsupported file types to be uploaded on site, does not throw any error.
